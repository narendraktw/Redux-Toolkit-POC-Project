# Template docker-push

# This template allows you to build and push your docker image to a Docker Hub account.
# The workflow allows running tests, code linting and security scans on feature branches (as well as master).
# The docker image will be validated and pushed to the docker registry after the code is merged to master.

# Prerequisites: $DOCKERHUB_USERNAME, $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD setup as deployment variables
